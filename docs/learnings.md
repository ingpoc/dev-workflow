# Development Workflow Learnings

## Session Management
- Track changes within sessions for better continuity
- Store handoff data in MongoDB for reliable state transfer
- Implement clear session commands for consistency

## Project Patterns
- Template common workflows (React, API, etc.)
- Track pattern success rates in different contexts
- Store implementation details for reuse

## Context Preservation
- Use session handoffs for state preservation
- Document changes and decisions within sessions
- Track pattern applications and results

## System Architecture
- MongoDB for long-term storage and patterns
- Session-based tracking for immediate context
- Command-based interaction for consistency

## Best Practices
- Regular handoffs between sessions
- Pattern success tracking
- Clear command structure
- Context documentation

## Implementation Tips
- Track all changes within sessions
- Store comprehensive handoff data
- Keep pattern implementations updated
- Document context transitions
